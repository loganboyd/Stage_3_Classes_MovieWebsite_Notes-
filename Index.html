      <h3>How the Web Works</h3> 
        <p>
          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with 
          each other. When a person goes to a web page like 
          www.google.com, their computer sends a 
          <span class="italic">HTTP Request</span> to 
          a <span class="italic">server</span>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends 
          it back to the user's computer where a <span class="italic">
          web browser</span> interprets the page and displays it on 
          the user's screen. 
          <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> 
          does a good job of explaining more.

      <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup 
          Language.</span> HTML documents form the majority of the 
          content on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents contain <span class="italic">text 
          content</span> which describes "what you see" and 
          <span class="italic">markup</span> which describes 
          "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This 
          video</a> gives a good overview.
          Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text.

      <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
        <p>
          HTML documents are made of HTML 
          <span class="bold">elements</span>. When writing HTML, we 
          tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML 
          <span class="bold">tags</span>.

      <h3>Computers are Dumb</h3>
        <p>
          Computers are stupid because they interpret 
          instructions literally. This makes them very 
          unforgiving since a small mistake by a 
          programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

      <h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> 
          or <span class="bold">block</span>. Block elements form 
          an "invisible topic" around the content inside of them.

      <h3> The "tree-like structure" of HTML </h3>
        <p> 
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML 
          elements can have other elements inside of them. You can 
          draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother 
          had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        </p>
        <p> 
          In HTML structure is used when writing the writing the code for a web page. for example, within a single div element, opening and closing, you may have other elements such as a heading, H2, or a pragraph, p. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series 
          of nested topices. There are topices inside of topices 
          inside of topices, and so on..

       <h3>The relationship between indented HTML and topics</h3>
        <p> 
          When you read an HTML document as 
          <span class="italic">text</span>, you see a wave of 
          changing indentations going up and down the left side 
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the 
          more deeply nested its corresponding "topic" is.

       <h3>Text Editors (for programming)</h3>
        <p> 
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors 
          (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the 
          programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors 
          will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you 
          write an opening tag.

      <h3>CSS</h3> 
        <p> 
          (CSS) - Cascading Style Sheets are used alongside HTML code to simplify the styling and look of a web page. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
      <h3>CSS Styling</h3>
        <p> 
          Inline and internal styling allows you to put the styling code side by side with standard HTML code. External style sheets are the preferred method and take advantage of efficiencies while coding.  
        </p>
        <p>
          To link an external style sheet use the following after the head tag:

       <h3>Box Sizing</h3>
        <p> 
          There are <span class="bold">four main points</span> that Jessica addressed about topic sizing.
          <br>
          1.  HTML elements are topices and each topic has 4 components.
          <br>
          2.  Because there are so many components to each topic, it can often be hard to get the size of a topic just right.
          <br>
          3.  There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.
          <br>
          a.  Set sizes in terms of percent rather than pixels.
          <br>
          b.  Set the topic-sizing attribute to border-topic for every element. 
          <br>
          <img src="seven.png" alt="code">
          <br>
          4.  Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.
          <br>
          A single Div will take up the entire width of a page
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
       <h3>Box Positioning</h3>
        <p> 
          1.  Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
          <br>
          2.  Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.

       <h3>Coding Process</h3>
        <p> 
          Code, Test, Refine 
          <br>
          1.  Look for natural topices
          <br>
          2.  Look for repeated styles and semantic elements
          <br> 
          3.  Write your HTML
          <br>
          4.  Apply styles 
          <br>
          5.  Fix things  
          <br>
          Repeat steps 3 and 4 until your page looks like your design model.

        <h3>Notes from Class</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Class</b> - the class key word allows us to make classes, you can think of a class as a blue print. A class can have both data and methods.<br> You can create multiple <b>instances</b> of a class. When you create an instance of a class, the class <b>constructor</b> gets called. This is essentially the <b>(__init__)</b> method within the class. <br><b>Constructors</b> use the key word <b>self</b> (self or instance in question) <br> All of the variables associated with a specific instance are called instance variables; these are unique to an <b>object</b> and can accessed using the self keyword inside the class and the instance name outside the class. <br><br> All of the <b>functions</b> inside the class, that are associated with an instance, and have the first argument of self are called <b>instance methods</b>.<br><br>

        <br><br>
        <b>Interpretation</b><br><br><b>Python object:</b> Class, Constructor, Instance Variables and Instance Methods<br>The Class is the highest level within the object and allows us to create and define multiple constructors.<br><br><b>Python program:</b> Instance<br>When writing a new program Object oriented programming allows us to call out and Object and an associated class to perform a predefined function.

        <h3>Stage 3 Terms</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Object-oriented programming</b> (OOP) languages such as Python allow programmers to build and define functions, classes and variables within a separate <b>Object</b>, or also known as a <b>Module</b>.  A <b>Module</b> allow for easy logical organization of Python code.<br><br> During the movie website project we created our own Module and pre-defined classes and variables to enable the program. We also used a the fresh_tomatoes.py module to dynamically create the HTML and CSS code needed to display our movie website.<br><br>
        <b>Classes</b> are a way of packaging variables and functions together for reuse.<br>Classes allow you to create new python programs that may use an instance to call out the instance variables within the predefined class.<br><br>
        <b>Variables</b><br><b>Instance variables</b> are defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.<br><br><b>Class variables</b> are shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables aren't used as frequently as instance variables are.<br>We use the class variable when we have variables that we want all of our instances to share. The example in the movie website was movie rating (e.g. G, PG, PG-13, and R). This list of ratings can be used by all movies; unique values are not needed here.<br>it is defined at the level of the class and is outside the init function. When the values are constant it is best practice to use all caps in the variable name.<br><br> Example: <br> (1) Define the variable: <br>
        <img src="nine.png" alt="code">  <br> 
        (2) Call out the object file (media), the Class (Movie) and the class variable (VALID_RATINGS): <br>
        <img src="ten.png" alt="code">  <br> 
        (3) The print output should mirror the define variables <br>
        <img src="eleven.png" alt="code"><br><br> 
        <b>Inheritance:</b> The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.<br><br>
        <b>Library:</b><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html">Python library of built in functions</a><br><br>
        <b>Constructor:</b>__init__ is a constructor, which is reserved in python code, and is used to create space to store a value.<br>
